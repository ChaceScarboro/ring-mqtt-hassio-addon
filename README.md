# Ring MQTT Hass.io Addon
This addon provides integration of Ring devices into Hass.io using the [ring-mqtt](https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt) script.  Currently most alarm devices are supported, as well as camera functions.  Camera support is disabled by default since these are supported via native Ring component in Home Assistant, but can be enabled if you prefer to use the support here.
